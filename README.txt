This is a simple exercise in Python that helps to highlight some of the basics 
of the language. It was written with Python 3.4.

Background:

The Fibonacci Sequence is an infinite series of numbers that begins with 
integers 0 and 1. The  subsequent digit in the sequence is always the sum of the 
last two integers in the series. It looks something like this:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...

Goal:

Have the program return the nth number within the Fibonacci Sequence, e.g., if 
the user wishes to know the first digit of Fibonacci, the program *must* return 
0. If they wish to know the second digit, the program *must* return 1. If they 
wish to know the 10th digit, the program *must* return 34, so on and so forth.
